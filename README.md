# DeepResearch (GraphFlow Edition)

Minimal, graph-first implementation of the DeepResearch agent pipeline. All multi-agent orchestration is powered directly by [`graph_flow`](https://docs.rs/graph-flow/latest/graph_flow/).

---

## Workspace Layout

```
deepresearch-rs/
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ crates/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deepresearch-core   # GraphFlow tasks + workflow runner
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ deepresearch-cli    # Demo binary that runs the workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                   # Testing guide and supporting docs
â”œâ”€â”€ AGENTS.md               # Developer reference
â”œâ”€â”€ PLAN.md                 # Roadmap / milestone tracking
â””â”€â”€ PRD.md                  # Product requirements
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Format & lint
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Run tests (offline if dependencies are cached)
cargo test --workspace --offline

# Execute the demo workflow
cargo run --offline -p deepresearch-cli
```

This produces a critic verdict summarising the analystâ€™s findings and enumerating supporting sources.

## Milestone Status

| Milestone | Status | Summary |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| M0 â€” Graph Foundation | âœ… | Core Researcher â†’ Analyst â†’ Critic tasks wired via `graph_flow` |
| M1 â€” Observability & Testing | âœ… | Structured tracing, integration test, documented context keys |
| M2+ | ðŸš§ | See `PLAN.md` for upcoming work (branching, persistence, retrieval, etc.) |

Refer to `PLAN.md` for the full roadmap.

## Testing

See `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` for the complete matrix. Key commands:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo check --offline
cargo test --offline -p deepresearch-core critic_verdict_is_non_empty
```
